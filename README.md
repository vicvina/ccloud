Collaborative Cloud, DHUB 2010

Collaborative Cloud is an installation which investigates distributed and decentralized design and fabrication. An online interface allows to design and give information to a piece of the cloud, thus anyone can participate in the project’s growth over 8 months.

The project was designed using Processing for the interface, and Grasshopper / Rhnoscript for geometry and population. Once a user submits a design, the interface outputs a data file as well as a PDF of the piece ready for fabrication with a laser cutter. As the database grows, these files are matched with a potential position on the cloud.
The physical construction took place at the Disseny Hub Barcelona (DHUB) in an exhibition titled: Fabrication Laboratory: New Scenarios for Design and Three Dimensional Production, curated by Marta Malé. The Collaborative Cloud is a project created by the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia, organized by DHUB, and designed by Luis E. Fraguada, Victor Viña, Areti Markopoulou, and YOU!
